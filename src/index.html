      <h3>Hi, there! Nina here.</h3>
      <p>
        I'm currently an SDE Intern with AWS at Amazon. I'm extremely passionate about learning, teaching, and helping others. Want an example?
        I taught myself how to change my car's oil, transmission oil, cabin and engine air filters, spark plugs, alternator, starter, brake
        pads and rotors, brake fluid, and battery. Yeah.. my car was crappy but I learned a lot from it! One day my old housemate had a friend
        over. They hung out and then he went to his car to leave. Guess what. It didn't start. My housemate called me, I did some diagnosing
        and determined it was the starter. We headed over to Autozone, arrived right before they closed, and got the starter. I helped him
        to replace it and taught him along the way. His car started up and he happily headed home.
      </p>

        I used to teach kids chess, swim, and parkour however I wanted to learn how to code for some time. I purchased a Python course on Udemy,
        watched tons of YouTube videos, and tried a bit of Codecademy. It felt like fate, last year (2022) a friend told me about Ada Developers
        Academy. I immediately looked up everything about Ada and knew it was for me. With only about an 8% acceptance rate and low chances of
        getting in the first time applying, I was accepted. I literally ran around my neighborhood, I was so excited.

        Now I'm interning at AWS. What have I done so far during my internship that started on Feb. 27th, 2023? Well, I'm glad you asked.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I integrated AWS AppConfig with an internal service which auto remediates configurations reducing deployment
          time for hardcoded data from weeks to just a few hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          I added local deployment to our team's AWS AppConfig repository making it fast
          and easy to deploy locally for testing. Previously, it was a manual process which involved copying and pasting code then removing it before
          putting up a code review. Now we can easily put in a few commands in the CLI.
        </li>
        <li>
          I onboarded the auto remediation internal service to a new region, improving reliability and accessibility. The service can now be 
          used, tested, and maintained in this new region.
        </li>
        <li>
          I assisted a teammate in building an account creation pipeline which automates AWS account creation with the team's metadata, permissions, 
          account type, and email associated with that account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the account creation pipeline, I created 20 pre-prod accounts for each prod region and onboarded our service so that we can accurately 
          test in those regions before releasing changes to production.
        </li>
        <li>
          I added important service metrics to my team's operational dashboard to view when the auto remediation service successfully creates
          an OpsItem, resolves an OpsItem, and the rate at which integration tests pass and fail for the service.
        </li>
      </ul>
